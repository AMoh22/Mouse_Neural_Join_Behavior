# Mouse_Neural_Join_Behavior

In this project I will use some deep learning tools to analyse the calcium imaging neural data, the project is seperated in three parts:

<ol>
  <li> Predict mouvement amplitude from neural activity.</li>
  <li> Neural activity dimensionality techniques.</li>
  <li> Genrative tools to make some image of mouse behavior based on the neural activity.</li>
</ol>

This projects is for my master thesis, for more informations read the provided paper in the repo.
